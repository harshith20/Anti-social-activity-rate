# Anti-Social Activity Analysis Project

## Objective
India's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) released the latest crime statistics, indicating a slight increase in crimes post-COVID lockdowns. 
Then , I had these questions in my mind

- How do socio-economic and health factors impact the prevalence of crimes ?
- What specific areas should policymakers consider to effectively reduce and mitigate the occurrences of these crimes?
- To understand these aspects comprehensively, this project aims to analyze the relationship between socio-economic indicators, health statistics, and crime rates.

  ## Project Goal
- Investigate the correlation between socio-economic and health-related factors and crime rates across all countries .
- Identify key considerations & insights for policymakers to mitigate and control crimes.


## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Sourced data from the World Bank database covering crime statistics and socio-economic/health indicators across multiple countries in the last 30 years.
- Conducted data preprocessing involving cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values using time-series methods.
- Applied outlier treatment to ensure data integrity and quality.

## Feature Importance and Regression Analysis
- Performed feature importance analysis to understand the significance of different features in relation to crime rates.
